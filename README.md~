# Step 0 - Install ruby 2.0 + rails

# Step 1 - Create the Rails App

rails new inTouch

# Step 2 - Gemfile + required dependencies for the workshop

Add required dependencies to Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'devise'
gem 'activeadmin', github: 'gregbell/active_admin'
gem 'haml-rails'
gem 'bootstrap-generators', '~> 3.0'
```

# Step 3 - Lets have an admin interface

```shell
rails generate active_admin:install
rake db:migrate
```

Start the server and go to http://localhost:3000/admin

```shell
rails s
```

default username is **admin@example.com** and the default password is **password**

# Step 4 - Lets have some authentication

Remember the devise gem we added to the Gemfile? ok, its time to put it to some use:

```ruby
rails generate devise:install
```

Answer *no* to the question that pops up.

Add default route to rails:
- edit the **config/routes.rb** and add the following line `root :to => "intouch#index"`

### Update the app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

Devise uses flash messages to display errors or success messages, so we are going to need to add something into our main layout:

```html
   <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
   <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
```

### Copy the devise views to your workspace for further customization

```
rails g devise:views
```

### Add the the devise user model

```
rails generate devise User
```

Run the Migrations

```
rake db:migrate
```
### Try to run the app server

```
rails s
```









# Step 5 - Lets design our entity model

# Step 6 - Lets add these to the admin

# Step 7 - Now that we are happy with all goodies, lets design the real app!

# Step 8 - Add an image to an user

# Step 9 - Integrate with facebook
